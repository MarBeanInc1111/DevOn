notetaker_notes = """Important Notes:
Don't write anything in the Note Title field.
Whatever notes you are told to make, write them in one go, don't press enter or type multiple times, because everytime you write, it will replace the prevoius content.
You do not need to Save the note. When asked to note something down, just write it on the notepad. That is enough."""
