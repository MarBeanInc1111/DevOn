# DevOn

What if you tried to do what Devin does, but using MultiOn's agents?

We use 3 separate MultiOn Agents, one each for programming, researching and notetaking.

Their activities are orchestrated and supervised by an overarching GPT-4V

Let's see how far this goes in 2 weeks.

Day 1:

Day 2:

Working with Replit is evidently problematic.

Day 3:

Since working with Replit was problematic, we got rid of it. A terminal is all you need. Still some kinks to be hammered out but this will work way better.

The main problem that remains is the terminal text input latency, but I have some ideas for solving this.

Day 4:

Took a little detour today - prototyped a Keyboard and Mouse-only Agent. Works surprisingly well, will try and use this as the Programmer.
