# DevOn

[Huggingface Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lordspline/devon)

What if you tried to do what Devin does, but using MultiOn's agents?

We use 3 separate MultiOn Agents, one each for programming, researching and notetaking.

Their activities are orchestrated and supervised by an overarching GPT-4V

Setup:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `bash start.sh`

Barebones Demo:

\*Note: This is a simplistic demo only meant to showcase the range of MultiOn's capabilities.
